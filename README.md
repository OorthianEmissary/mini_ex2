What constitues a program?
A program is a set of commands given to a computer in order to reach a wanted result. 

My coding process:
My coding process for this project was quite simple. I watched a lot of the Coding Train videos on p5.js on YouTube to reach a point, where I felt confident in my ability to program that I could make an acceptable piece of code. The idea of using the Zalgo text came upon reflexions on what errors, noise and glitches was. Though not exactly a glitch, as it's more abuse of the UnixCode, the text seemed to make a physical representation of noise. Unpleasing to the eye, as noise is unpleasing to the ears. The random placement of the text as well as generation there of, came as a biproduct of this.
As added reflection upon glitches as the subject, the box isn't a special trigger, instead the whole screen is, which again can be seen as a form of glitch, as the text is misleading.
Initially I had wanted the Windows Error sound to play constantly in the bagground as well as Vaporwave music, but hosting my own server deemed too big a task. Later version of this project might incorperate this element.

In conclusion: The coding process was more studying how to program than program, though the finished result lacked features that I initially wanted, but lacked the ability to make.

What is an error?
An error is an unwanted way the program behaves. In contrast to glitches, which are minor inconveniences, errors are typically more fatal, sometimes forcing programs to close or in rare cases forcing the user to restart the computer. Errors usually come from problems between pieces of code or lacking elements in the code.
Though inconvenient, some errors can be viewed for their aesthetical qualities, though they may be hard to capture naturally, whereas glitches are easier to capture.
